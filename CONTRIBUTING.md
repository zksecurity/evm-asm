# Contributing to EvmAsm

Thanks for contributing.

Start with:

- [`README.md`](README.md) for the project overview
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for build instructions, project structure, and proof guidance
- [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the current roadmap and task status

Before sending work for review:

- Run `lake build` and confirm it succeeds with no errors and no `sorry`.
- Avoid leaving `sorry` in finished work unless the change is explicitly meant to preserve partial progress.
- When adding a new `.lean` file, make sure it is imported so that it is included in the default build target.
- Do not add `set_option maxHeartbeats` or `set_option maxRecDepth` to files. These are configured globally in `lakefile.toml`. If a proof times out, restructure it (split into smaller lemmas, add intermediate `have` bindings) instead of raising limits. Timeouts are usually caused by unification issues, not insufficient heartbeats.
- Do not use `native_decide` or `bv_decide`. All proofs must be kernel-checkable. Use `decide` for concrete decidable propositions, or `omega`/`simp`/`ext` for bitvector reasoning.

## Spec and Proof Guidelines

- **No duplicate memory locations in preconditions.** A precondition that mentions the same memory location twice becomes unusable because separation logic requires disjointness.
- **Do not existentially quantify results of computation.** Keep computed results concrete in postconditions — existentials hide information that downstream specs need.
- **Avoid excessive `let` bindings in theorem statements.** Many `let`s in a spec statement is an anti-pattern that slows elaboration. When unavoidable, bundle the postcondition into an `@[irreducible] def` returning `Assertion` (see the Bundling Postconditions section of [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)).

## Style Notes

- Keep imports at the top of the file.
- Follow the naming conventions and proof patterns documented in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
- Use `bv_addr` (not `bv_omega`) for address offset equalities — see the Build Performance section of `AGENTS.md`.

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Create feature branches for new work.
- Use meaningful commit messages.
