## ⚠️ Warning: Experimental Prototype Only

**DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT FOR ANYTHING OF VALUE.**

This is an experimental research prototype with significant limitations:

- **No RISC-V spec compliance**: The instruction semantics are hand-written and
  have NOT been validated against the official RISC-V specification. There may
  be subtle (or not-so-subtle) deviations from actual RISC-V behavior.
- **No conformance testing**: No systematic testing has been performed to verify
  that this implementation matches real RISC-V processors or simulators.
- **Prototype quality**: This code is for educational and research purposes to
  explore verified macro assembly techniques, not for production use.

If you need a verified RISC-V formalization, consider
[sail-riscv-lean](https://github.com/opencompl/sail-riscv-lean), which is
machine-generated from the official RISC-V Sail specification.

## Motivation: Eliminating Compiler Trust in zkEVM

The usual way to use zkVMs is to compile high-level programs to RISC-V
assembly, then prove correctness of the execution trace using a zero-knowledge
proof system. The proof covers the *execution trace*, but it cannot cover the
*compiler*. If the compiler is buggy or malicious, the resulting program may not
match the developer's intent, even though the ZK proof is valid, and even if the
source code is correct.

**evm.asm** explores an alternative: write programs directly as RISC-V code,
and *prove* their correctness in Lean 4 before the ZK proof is ever
generated. The goal is that a developer never has to trust a compiler.

More specifically, evm.asm targets the **zkEVM**.

## Key Idea

Lean 4 serves simultaneously as:

1. **An assembler**: Instructions are an inductive type; programs are lists of
   instructions with sequential composition (`;;`).
2. **A macro language**: Lean functions that produce programs act as macros,
   using all of Lean's facilities (recursion, pattern matching, conditionals).
3. **A specification language**: Hoare triples with separation logic assertions
   express correctness properties of EVM opcodes and macro compositions.
4. **A proof assistant**: Lean's kernel verifies that macros meet their
   specifications, with no external oracle required.

## The `add_mulc` Macro

The simplest example is `add_mulc` (inspired by "Coq: The world's best macro assembler?" cited above), a macro that multiplies a register by a
compile-time constant using the shift-and-add algorithm:

```lean
def add_mulc (nbits : Nat) (rd rs : Reg) (m : Nat) : Program :=
  match nbits with
  | 0 => prog_skip
  | nbits' + 1 =>
    if m % 2 == 1 then
      ADD rd rd rs ;;
      SLLI rs rs 1 ;;
      add_mulc nbits' rd rs (m / 2)
    else
      SLLI rs rs 1 ;;
      add_mulc nbits' rd rs (m / 2)
```

The specification uses separating conjunction:

```lean
theorem add_mulc_spec (m nbits : Nat) (hm : m < 2 ^ nbits)
    (rd rs : Reg) (hrd : rd ≠ .x0) (hrs : rs ≠ .x0)
    (v w : Word) :
    ⦃(rd ↦ᵣ v) ** (rs ↦ᵣ w)⦄
    add_mulc nbits rd rs m
    ⦃fun s => s.getReg rd = v + w * BitVec.ofNat 32 m⦄
```

## Status

This is a **prototype** demonstrating the approach. Current state:

- **Working**: Machine model, instruction semantics, program composition,
  separation logic framework, Hoare triple infrastructure, concrete
  correctness proofs via `native_decide`.
- **Proved**:
  - Separation logic properties (commutativity, associativity, unit)
  - Hoare triple structural rules (skip, sequence, consequence, frame, existential)
  - Register file lemmas, swap correctness, `add_mulc_correct`
  - CPS-style branch specs (`cpsBranch`, `cpsNBranch`), `if_eq` control flow
  - ECALL/HALT termination (SP1 convention)
  - EVM 256-bit bitwise ops: AND, OR, XOR, NOT (full specs)
  - EVM 256-bit arithmetic: ADD, SUB (full specs)
  - EVM 256-bit comparisons: LT, GT, EQ, ISZERO (full specs)
  - EVM stack ops: POP, PUSH0, DUP1, SWAP1 (concrete), DUPn/SWAPn for 1 ≤ n ≤ 16 (generic)
- **TODO**: More control flow macros (loops, function calls), MLOAD/MSTORE,
  additional arithmetic (MUL, DIV, MOD), connect to sail-riscv-lean for full
  ISA coverage.
