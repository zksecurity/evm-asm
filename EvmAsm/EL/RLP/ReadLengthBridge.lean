  Reusable result bridge for RLP long-form length-field decoding (GH #120).

/-- Decoded long-form RLP length field plus the input remainder after the
    length bytes. -/
structure LengthFieldResult where
  length : Nat
  rest : List Byte
  deriving Repr

/--
Decode exactly `n` bytes as a canonical big-endian RLP length field.

This is a small executable-spec bridge over `readLength`: later RISC-V
decoder phases can target this result object without duplicating the
leading-zero rejection and remainder plumbing.

Distinctive token: RLP.ReadLengthBridge.decodeLengthField? #120.
