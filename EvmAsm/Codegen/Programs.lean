  EvmAsm.Codegen.Programs

  Registry of programs the codegen tool knows how to emit, each as a
  `BuildUnit` (verified body + optional wrapping).

/-! ## smoke — M0 toolchain validation -/

/-- M0 smoke target. Loads two immediates, adds them, falls through to the
    halt stub appended by `emitBuildUnit`. Expected post-state: `x12 = 100`.
    No memory setup or I/O needed; the post-state isn't observable from
    `ziskemu` until M2 wires `write_output`. -/
def smoke : Program :=
  LI .x10 (42 : Word) ;;
  LI .x11 (58 : Word) ;;
  ADD .x12 .x10 .x11

/-! ## evm_add — M2 first verified-body end-to-end -/

/-- Operand A as four little-endian 64-bit limbs (low limb first).
    Chosen so the test exercises the limb-0→limb-1 carry: A = 2^64 - 1. -/
def evmAddOperandA : List UInt64 := [0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, 0, 0, 0]

/-- Operand B as four little-endian 64-bit limbs (low limb first).
    B = 1. -/
def evmAddOperandB : List UInt64 := [0x1, 0, 0, 0]

/-- Expected 256-bit sum, also four LE 64-bit limbs.
    A + B = 2^64, which means limb 0 = 0 and limb 1 = 1, others 0. -/
def evmAddExpectedSum : List UInt64 := [0x0, 0x1, 0, 0]

/-- ZisK public-output region. Bytes written here at `OUTPUT_ADDR + 4·k`
    surface in `ziskemu`'s `-o <file>` output and `-c` console log.
    Constant taken from `zisk/ziskos/entrypoint/src/ziskos_definitions.rs`
    (`OUTPUT_ADDR = 0xa001_0000`). Max 64 u32 slots (256 bytes). -/
def OUTPUT_ADDR : Word := 0xa0010000

/-- evm_add expects `x12` to point at 64 bytes of memory: the 32-byte
    operand A at offset 0..32 and operand B at offset 32..64. After it
    runs, `x12` has been advanced by 32 and points at the 32-byte sum
    that overwrote operand B's slot.

    `la x12, operands` is a GNU-as pseudo that expands to
    `auipc x12, %hi(operands)` + `addi x12, x12, %lo(operands)` —
    PC-relative, resolved by the linker after the `.data` section's
    address is known. We keep it as raw asm text because `la` isn't in
    our `Instr` enum. -/
def evmAddPrologue : String :=
  "  la x12, operands"

/-- Copy the 32-byte sum from `mem[x12 .. x12+32]` into ZisK's public
    output region (`OUTPUT_ADDR .. OUTPUT_ADDR+32`). Plain 64-bit
    stores; no syscall (ZisK output is memory-mapped, not ecall-based).

    Lives in the verified Program world: every instruction is in
    `Instr`, so it benefits from `emitInstr` totality and the round-trip
    tests. -/
