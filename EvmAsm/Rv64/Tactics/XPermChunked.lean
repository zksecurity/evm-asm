`xperm_chunked h` has the same user-facing semantics as `xperm_hyp h`:
given `h : P s`, close a goal `Q s` when `P` and `Q` are sepConj
permutations.

This prototype is deliberately opt-in. It routes through the existing
proved permutation builder so call sites can migrate one at a time while
the chunk partition pre-pass evolves behind the same surface.
