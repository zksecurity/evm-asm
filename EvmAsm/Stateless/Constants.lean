  EvmAsm.Stateless.Constants

  Well-known Ethereum hash constants the stateless guest references
  in multiple places. Centralising them keeps each value at a
  single source of truth and gives specs a stable name to refer
  to (instead of inline 64-hex-char literals).

  ## Constants exported

  - `keccak256EmptyHashHex` -- `keccak256(b"") =
       c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`.
       Used as `EMPTY_CODE_HASH` (accounts with no contract code)
       and as a trivial baseline in `Stateless/Headers/BlockHash`
       tests.
  - `emptyTrieRootHex`      -- `keccak256(rlp_encode_empty_list) =
       56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421`.
       The MPT root of an empty trie. Used as `storage_root` for
       accounts with no storage, and as the initial state root
       in pre-genesis testing.
  - `emptyOmmerHashHex`     -- `keccak256(rlp_encode_empty_list)`
       (same as `emptyTrieRootHex`). Post-merge headers store this
       as the `ommers_hash` constant.

  Each constant is a 64-hex-character `String` because the
  consumers (asm test fixtures, Python harnesses, debug output)
  all consume hex. A `ByteVector 32` form can be added later if
  Lean-side proofs need byte-level reasoning.

namespace EvmAsm.Stateless.Constants

/-- Hex string of `keccak256(b"")`. Same value also doubles as
    `EMPTY_CODE_HASH` (accounts without contract code reference
    this hash; per EIP-161 these accounts get deleted from the
    state trie). -/
def keccak256EmptyHashHex : String :=
  "c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470"

/-- Hex string of `keccak256(rlp_encode([])) =
    keccak256(0x80)`. The MPT root of an empty trie; accounts with
    no storage have `storage_root = emptyTrieRootHex`. Also the
    post-merge `ommers_hash` constant -- since post-merge headers
    never reference ommers, the field is always this fixed value. -/
def emptyTrieRootHex : String :=
  "56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421"

/-- Alias for `emptyTrieRootHex`. Post-merge headers carry
    `ommers_hash = keccak256(rlp([]))` because there are no ommer
    blocks in proof-of-stake. -/
