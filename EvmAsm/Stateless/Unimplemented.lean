  EvmAsm.Stateless.Unimplemented

  The stateless-guest port reaches `unimplemented_exit` whenever it
  encounters a code path that has not been implemented yet -- most
  notably every EVM precompile, every cryptographic operation we haven't
  routed through an ECALL bridge yet, and every transaction-type
  variant outside the current scope.

  Distinct from HALT (t0 = 0): we use t0 = 0x10 (write_output) to
  surface a 32-byte marker on `OUTPUT_ADDR`, then halt. The marker is
  `0xFE` repeated 8 times to make Unimplemented exits easy to spot
  in a hex dump and distinguishable from a normal SSZ
  `StatelessValidationResult` (the first byte of a normal
  `new_payload_request_root` is unconstrained, but the full 8-byte
  `0xFE..FE` prefix has negligible collision probability).

  This is also distinct from a normal validation failure
  (`successful_validation = false`): "Unimplemented" means the
  RISC-V code refused to even *try* to validate the input, whereas
  `successful_validation = false` means the RISC-V code attempted
  validation and detected a problem.

  Reason codes (the second 8-byte word in the marker is the reason
  code, written by the caller before invoking `unimplemented_exit`):

  | Reason | Code | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|
  | `PRECOMPILE`           | 0x01 | precompile dispatch (a0 holds addr 0x01..0x14) |
  | `TX_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED`  | 0x02 | unsupported transaction envelope |
  | `EIP7702_DELEGATION`   | 0x03 | SetCodeTransaction delegation |
  | `EIP4844_BLOB`         | 0x04 | blob-tx handling |
  | `EIP7609_BAL`          | 0x05 | block access list generation |
  | `WITNESS_MISSING_NODE` | 0x06 | MPT walk hit a missing witness node |
  | `STATE_ROOT_MISMATCH`  | 0x07 | recomputed state root != header |
  | `STF_BODY`             | 0x08 | the STF body itself is not yet implemented |

  ## Memory it reads / writes
  - reads:  caller-supplied reason code via `x10 (a0)`
  - writes: 32 bytes to `OUTPUT_ADDR + 0..32`
  - exits:  `ECALL` with `t0 = 0` (HALT)
