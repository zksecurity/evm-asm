  EvmAsm.Evm64.Exp.AddrNormAttr

  Declares the `exp_addr` simp attribute used by `Exp/AddrNorm.lean`.

  Split out from `AddrNorm.lean` because Lean 4 does not allow an attribute
  to be used in the same file in which it is declared. Downstream code should
  import `Exp/AddrNorm.lean` (which imports this file) rather than this file
  directly; tagged EXP address lemmas live there.
