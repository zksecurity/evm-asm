  EvmAsm.Evm64.SDiv.Compose.Base

  Shared composition infrastructure for SDIV: `sdivCode` (the union of
  all sub-block `CodeReq`s), subsumption helpers tying sub-block codes
  back to `sdivCode`, and shared length lemmas.

  Skeleton placeholder for GH #90 (beads slice evm-asm-kyp6). Concrete
  definitions will be added once `evm_sdiv` is laid out (slice
  evm-asm-01uh) and the per-block specs from `LimbSpec.lean` start
  composing.
