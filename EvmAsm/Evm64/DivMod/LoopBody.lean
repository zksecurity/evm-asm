  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.LoopBody

  Hierarchical composition of the 114-instruction Knuth Algorithm D main loop body.
  Composes sub-specs from LimbSpec.lean into a single cpsBranchWithin for one iteration,
  then proves the inductive loop spec via cpsTriple_loop_with_perm.

  Issue #87: DIV/MOD loop body composition.
