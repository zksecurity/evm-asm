  ## The Macro Assembler Pattern

  The key idea from Kennedy et al. is:

  1. **Instructions** are data: they are an inductive type in Lean.
  2. **Programs** are lists of instructions with sequential composition (;;).
  3. **Macros** are Lean functions that produce programs. They can use
     all of Lean's facilities: recursion, pattern matching, conditionals.
  4. **Specifications** are Hoare triples using separation logic.
  5. **Proofs** verify that macros meet their specifications.

  Lean serves as both the macro language and the verification language.
  The `add_mulc` example shows a recursive macro that compiles a
  multiply-by-constant into a sequence of shifts and adds, with concrete
  correctness verified by `native_decide` and a general specification
  stated using Hoare triples and separating conjunction.
