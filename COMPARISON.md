## Overview

This document compares hand-written RISC-V assembly for EVM opcodes (evm-asm) against
LLVM-compiled Rust using `ethereum-types::U256` (as used by ethrex) targeting **riscv64**.

**evm-asm**: Hand-written straight-line RV64IM assembly in Lean 4, formally verified.
256-bit values stored as 4 little-endian 64-bit limbs in memory. Register x12 = EVM
stack pointer. Most instructions are straight-line (no branches); shifts, BYTE, and
SIGNEXTEND use dispatch branches. DIV/MOD use a loop (Knuth Algorithm D).

**Compiled Rust**: `ethereum-types::U256` (internally `[u64; 4]`) compiled with
`rustc --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf -O2` (opt-level=2, thin LTO, codegen-units=1,
panic=abort, `-C target-feature=-c` to disable compressed instructions for fair comparison).

**Key difference from the rv32 comparison**: On riscv64, `[u64; 4]` is **native** — each
limb fits in a single register. The massive rv32 penalty (u64-on-u32 carry branches,
double-width operations) is gone. The gap between hand-written and compiled code narrows
dramatically, and for some operations the compiler matches or beats evm-asm.

## Summary Table

Rust counts include all callees (partial_cmp, checked_div, div_mod, shl helper, etc.)
to reflect the true total instruction cost. evm-asm counts are static instruction counts
from the Lean source.

## Analysis

### The Gap Narrows Dramatically on 64-bit

The move from rv32 to rv64 eliminates the fundamental architectural disadvantage that
penalized `[u64; 4]` on a 32-bit target:

| Opcode | rv32 ratio | rv64 ratio | Change |
|--------|----------:|----------:|--------|
| ADD    | 1.40x (87/62) | 0.97x (29/30) | u64 carry overhead eliminated |
| SUB    | 1.61x (100/62) | 1.07x (32/30) | u64 borrow overhead eliminated |
| AND    | 1.00x (33/33) | 1.00x (17/17) | Still identical, now 4 limbs |
| NOT    | 1.04x (25/24) | 1.08x (13/12) | Still near-identical |
| ISZERO | 1.33x (32/24) | **0.75x (9/12)** | Rust now wins |
| SWAP1  | 4.03x (129/32) | **9.31x (149/16)** | Ratio worsened (fewer evm-asm limbs) |
| SHR    | ~3.6x (226/~63) | 1.48x (133/90) | Callee overhead reduced |

On rv32, ADD and SUB were the poster children for the u64-on-u32 penalty. On rv64,
the compiler produces nearly identical code — 29 instructions vs evm-asm's 30, with
only 2 conditional branches for cross-limb carry propagation.

### Where the Compiler Matches evm-asm

**Bitwise operations** (AND, OR, XOR) are identical at 17 instructions — the optimal
minimum for 4 limbs: 8 LD + 4 ALU + 4 SD + 1 (ret/ADDI).

**NOT** is 13 vs 12 — the single extra instruction is `ret`.

**ADD** and **MUL** are equal or within 1 instruction. The compiler achieves textbook
optimal code for these because u64 is native and the schoolbook algorithm is the only
reasonable choice at 4 limbs.

**ISZERO** — the compiler **wins**: 9 instructions (4 LD + 3 OR + SEQZ + ret) vs
evm-asm's 12. evm-asm uses 12 because it stores a full 256-bit result (1 SLTIU +
4 SD for zeros), while Rust returns a scalar. If evm-asm returned a scalar, it would
be 8 instructions.

**LT** is identical at 26 total. Rust delegates to `partial_cmp` (18 instrs) but the
caller wrapper is very slim (8 instrs: prologue + call + result extraction + epilogue).

### Where evm-asm Still Wins

**SWAP1** (9.3x): The most dramatic difference. `core::mem::swap` still generates
byte-level `lbu`/`sb` operations even on rv64, producing 149 instructions (64 lbu +
64 sb + prologue/epilogue) vs evm-asm's 16 (4 × (LD + LD + SD + SD)).

**SAR** (2.65x): Arithmetic right shift requires: (1) comparing shift amount to 256
via `partial_cmp`, (2) performing the shift, (3) filling sign bits via the `shl` helper.
Three function calls with prologue/epilogue overhead add up.

**SIGNEXTEND** (4.71x): Similar callee overhead — `partial_cmp` for bounds checking,
`shl` helper for mask creation, plus panic paths for bounds checks.

**DIV/MOD** (2.5x): Rust's generic `div_mod` implementation (724 instructions with
74 branches) vs evm-asm's Knuth Algorithm D (~316 instructions). Both use Knuth's
algorithm, but the compiler's generic version handles all sizes (U128/U256/U512) with
extra dispatch logic.

**Signed comparisons** (SLT/SGT, 1.5x): evm-asm uses a straight-line MSB-sign +
borrow chain (25 instrs); Rust checks sign bits then delegates to `partial_cmp`
(38 total including callee).

### Per-Category Analysis

**Arithmetic** (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD): The gap is near-zero for add/sub/mul on
rv64. Division remains 2.5x because Rust's generic multi-precision division carries
unnecessary generality.

**Bitwise** (AND, OR, XOR, NOT): Effectively identical. The compiler achieves optimal
code because bitwise operations have no carry propagation.

**Comparison** (LT, GT, EQ, ISZERO, SLT, SGT): Mixed results. LT and EQ are tied.
ISZERO favors Rust. SLT/SGT favor evm-asm (1.5x) due to partial_cmp callee overhead.

**Shift** (SHR, SHL, SAR): 1.5-2.7x advantage for evm-asm. The main overhead in
Rust is the `partial_cmp` call to check if shift >= 256, plus function call overhead
for the shift helpers.

**Byte/Sign** (BYTE, SIGNEXTEND): 1.8-4.7x advantage for evm-asm. Complex dispatch
logic in both, but Rust adds callee overhead and panic paths.

**Stack** (SWAP1, POP, PUSH0, DUP1): The dedicated stack pointer register (x12)
gives evm-asm a structural advantage. SWAP1's 9.3x ratio is the largest in the table,
caused by `core::mem::swap` using byte-level operations.

### Branch Count Analysis

| Opcode | evm-asm branches | Rust branches | Winner |
|--------|:----------------:|:-------------:|--------|
| ADD    | 0 | 2  | evm-asm (branchless, ~same count) |
| SUB    | 0 | 3  | evm-asm (branchless) |
| MUL    | 0 | 0  | Tie |
| AND    | 0 | 0  | Tie |
| OR     | 0 | 0  | Tie |
| XOR    | 0 | 0  | Tie |
| NOT    | 0 | 0  | Tie |
| ISZERO | 0 | 0  | Rust (fewer total instrs) |
| LT     | 0 | 5  | Tie (same total) |
| GT     | 0 | 5  | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| EQ     | 0 | 1+? | ~Tie |
| SLT    | Yes | 7  | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| SGT    | Yes | 7  | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| SHR    | Yes | 25 | evm-asm (fewer branches + fewer total) |
| SHL    | Yes | 22 | evm-asm (fewer branches + fewer total) |
| SAR    | Yes | 38 | evm-asm (fewer branches + fewer total) |
| BYTE   | Yes | 15 | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| SIGNEXTEND | Yes | 33 | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| DIV    | Yes (loop) | ~79 | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| MOD    | Yes (loop) | ~79 | evm-asm (fewer total) |
| SWAP1  | 0 | 0  | evm-asm (16 vs 149) |

### zkVM Cost Model Implications

In zero-knowledge virtual machines (SP1, RISC Zero), the cost model is:
- Each instruction takes ~1 cycle to prove
- Memory operations (LD/SD) ≈ ALU operations in cost
- Branches cost the same as other instructions (no prediction benefit)
- Function calls (CALL/RET) are just branch + register save, same cost

Under this model:
1. **Instruction count is all that matters** — branches aren't "free" in zkVM
2. **For 15 of 21 opcodes**, evm-asm has equal or fewer instructions
3. **ISZERO is the sole case** where compiled Rust beats evm-asm on instruction count
4. **The architectural wins remain**: dedicated stack pointer, branchless arithmetic,
   no function call overhead, no panic paths
5. **SWAP1** is the highest-impact optimization opportunity for compiled Rust (9.3x gap)

## Per-Opcode Assembly Comparison

### ADD — Near-Identical on rv64

**evm-asm** (30 instructions, 0 branches):
```asm
# Limb 0: sum, carry
ld   x7, 0(x12)        # a[0]
ld   x6, 32(x12)       # b[0]
add  x7, x7, x6        # sum = a[0]+b[0]
sltu x5, x7, x6        # carry = sum < b[0]
sd   x12, x7, 32       # result[0] = sum
# Limb 1: sum + carry_in, carry_out = carry1 | carry2
ld   x7, 8(x12)        # a[1]
ld   x6, 40(x12)       # b[1]
add  x7, x7, x6        # psum = a[1]+b[1]
sltu x11, x7, x6       # carry1 = psum < b[1]
add  x7, x7, x5        # result = psum + carry_in
sltu x6, x7, x5        # carry2 = result < carry_in
or   x5, x11, x6       # carry_out = carry1 | carry2
sd   x12, x7, 40       # result[1]
# ... (limbs 2-3 identical pattern) ...
addi x12, x12, 32      # pop operand
```

**Compiled Rust** (29 instructions, 2 branches):
```asm
ld   a6, 0(a1)         # a[0]
ld   a3, 8(a1)         # a[1]
ld   a5, 0(a2)         # b[0]
ld   a4, 8(a2)         # b[1]
add  a6, a6, a5        # sum[0]
add  a4, a4, a3        # sum[1] (partial)
sltu a7, a4, a3        # carry from limb 1
bgeu a6, a5, .skip     # branch: if no carry from limb 0
  addi a4, a4, 1       #   add carry to limb 1
  seqz a3, a4          #   check for wrap-around
  add  a7, a7, a3      #   propagate carry
.skip:
ld   a3, 16(a1)        # a[2]
ld   a5, 16(a2)        # b[2]
add  a5, a5, a3        # sum[2] (partial)
sltu a3, a5, a3        # carry from limb 2 add
beqz a7, .skip2        # branch: skip carry propagation if 0
  add  a7, a7, a5      #   add carry
  sltu a5, a7, a5      #   check for wrap
  add  a3, a3, a5      #   propagate
  mv   a5, a7
.skip2:
ld   a1, 24(a1)        # a[3]
ld   a2, 24(a2)        # b[3]
add  a1, a1, a2        # sum[3]
add  a1, a1, a3        # + carry_in (no carry_out needed)
sd   a6, 0(a0)         # store results
sd   a4, 8(a0)
sd   a5, 16(a0)
sd   a1, 24(a0)
ret
```

Remarkable: the compiler produces **1 fewer instruction** than hand-written assembly.
Rust's 2 branches (for carry propagation) sometimes skip work, while evm-asm always
executes the full carry chain. On average, the executed instruction count may be even
lower for Rust when carries are rare.

### MUL — Identical Instruction Count

**evm-asm** (63 instructions, 0 branches): schoolbook 4×4 multiplication using
`MUL`/`MULHU` pairs with column-wise accumulation.

**Compiled Rust** (63 instructions, 0 branches):
```asm
# Prologue: save 4 callee-saved registers
addi sp, sp, -32
sd   s0, 24(sp)
sd   s1, 16(sp)
sd   s2, 8(sp)
sd   s3, 0(sp)
# Load all limbs
ld   a3, 0(a1)         # a[0]
ld   t0, 8(a1)         # a[1]
ld   a7, 16(a1)        # a[2]
ld   a6, 24(a1)        # a[3]
ld   a1, 0(a2)         # b[0]
ld   a5, 8(a2)         # b[1]
ld   a4, 16(a2)        # b[2]
ld   t3, 24(a2)        # b[3]
# 16 MUL/MULHU operations for all cross-products
mul  t1, a3, a1        # a[0]*b[0] low
mulhu t2, a3, a1       # a[0]*b[0] high
mul  a2, t0, a1        # a[1]*b[0] low
# ... column accumulation with ADD/SLTU ...
sd   t1, 0(a0)         # result[0]
sd   a6, 8(a0)         # result[1]
sd   a7, 16(a0)        # result[2]
sd   a1, 24(a0)        # result[3]
# Epilogue: restore registers
ld   s0, 24(sp)
ld   s1, 16(sp)
ld   s2, 8(sp)
ld   s3, 0(sp)
addi sp, sp, 32
ret
```

Both implementations use the same schoolbook algorithm with `MUL`/`MULHU` pairs.
The compiler spills 4 callee-saved registers (8 instrs for save/restore), while
evm-asm avoids this by using scratch registers. Despite the spill overhead, both
arrive at exactly 63 instructions.

### AND / OR / XOR — Identical

Both produce exactly 17 instructions: 8 LD + 4 ALU + 4 SD + 1 (ret/ADDI).

**Compiled Rust** (AND shown):
```asm
ld   a6, 0(a1)         ld   a3, 0(a2)
ld   a7, 8(a1)         ld   a4, 8(a2)
ld   t0, 16(a1)        ld   a5, 16(a2)
ld   a1, 24(a1)        ld   a2, 24(a2)
and  a3, a3, a6
and  a4, a4, a7
and  a5, a5, t0
and  a1, a1, a2
sd   a3, 0(a0)
sd   a4, 8(a0)
sd   a5, 16(a0)
sd   a1, 24(a0)
ret
```

### ISZERO — Compiler Wins

**evm-asm** (12 instructions, 0 branches):
```asm
ld   x7, 0(x12)        # a[0]
ld   x6, 8(x12)        # a[1]
or   x7, x7, x6
ld   x6, 16(x12)       # a[2]
or   x7, x7, x6
ld   x6, 24(x12)       # a[3]
or   x7, x7, x6
sltiu x7, x7, 1        # x7 = (OR_reduce == 0) ? 1 : 0
sd   x12, x7, 0        # result[0] = boolean
sd   x12, x0, 8        # result[1] = 0
sd   x12, x0, 16       # result[2] = 0
sd   x12, x0, 24       # result[3] = 0
```

**Compiled Rust** (9 instructions, 0 branches):
```asm
ld   a1, 0(a0)
ld   a2, 8(a0)
ld   a3, 16(a0)
ld   a0, 24(a0)
or   a1, a1, a2
or   a0, a0, a3
or   a0, a0, a1
seqz a0, a0
ret
```

Rust wins because it returns a **scalar** (u64), while evm-asm stores a full 256-bit
result on the EVM stack (4 limbs, 3 of which are zero). The core logic is identical
(4 LD + 3 OR + 1 compare), but evm-asm adds 4 SD stores. This is an inherent
architectural difference — evm-asm's EVM stack uses 256-bit-wide slots.

### SWAP1 — Still Byte-Level on rv64

**evm-asm** (16 instructions, 0 branches):
```asm
ld   x7, 0(x12)        # top[0]
ld   x6, 32(x12)       # second[0]
sd   x12, x6, 0        # top[0] = second[0]
sd   x12, x7, 32       # second[0] = top[0]
# ... 3 more limb swaps ...
```

**Compiled Rust** (149 instructions, 0 branches):
```asm
# Prologue: save 9 callee-saved registers (s0-s8)
addi sp, sp, -80
sd   s0, 72(sp)
sd   s1, 64(sp)
# ... save s2-s8 ...
# Byte-by-byte swap — still lbu/sb even on rv64!
lbu  t1, 0(a0)         # load byte 0 of a
lbu  t0, 1(a0)
lbu  t5, 2(a0)
lbu  t4, 3(a0)
lbu  s2, 4(a0)
lbu  t6, 5(a0)
lbu  s5, 6(a0)
lbu  s6, 7(a0)
lbu  s3, 0(a1)
lbu  s4, 1(a1)
# ... 54 more lbu/sb pairs ...
# Epilogue: restore 9 registers
ret
```

The **9.3x gap** is actually worse than rv32's 4.0x (129/32), because evm-asm now
uses 4 word-level `LD`/`SD` swaps (16 instrs) instead of 8 `LW`/`SW` swaps (32 instrs),
while Rust's `core::mem::swap` still uses byte-level operations regardless of target.
Each `lbu` loads 1 byte vs `ld` loading 8 bytes — an **8x data movement inefficiency**.

### DIV — Generic vs Specialized

**evm-asm** (~316 instructions, loop with branches): Implements Knuth Algorithm D
with a specialized 49-instruction subroutine. The implementation is tailored for
256-bit ÷ 256-bit with 64-bit limbs.

**Compiled Rust** (~794 total, ~79 branches): The call chain is:
1. `u256_div` (42 instrs): loads operands, calls checked_div, handles Option
2. `checked_div` (28 instrs): checks for zero divisor, calls div_mod
3. `div_mod` (724 instrs, 74 branches): generic multi-precision division

The `div_mod` function handles all sizes (U128/U256/U512) through a generic
implementation, adding dispatch overhead. Both use Knuth's algorithm at the core.

## Cross-Cutting Analysis

### U256 Internal Representation

| Aspect | evm-asm (rv64) | Rust (ethereum-types, rv64) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Internal type | 4 × u64 in memory | [u64; 4] in registers/memory |
| Layout | LE limbs at stack pointer | LE limbs via pointers |
| Carry propagation | Per-64-bit limb (uniform) | Per-64-bit limb (native) |
| Register pressure | x5-x7, x11, x12 (5 regs) | a0-a7, t0-t6, s0-s8 (up to 22) |
| Function calls | None (inline) | partial_cmp, div_mod, shl, memcmp |

The rv32 penalty for `[u64; 4]` (2-register per limb, carry branches) is **gone** on
rv64. Both use the same underlying representation (4 × u64). The remaining differences
are structural: evm-asm uses a dedicated stack pointer and avoids function calls;
Rust uses standard ABI calling conventions with callees.

### Stack Architecture

| Aspect | evm-asm | Rust |
|--------|---------|------|
| Stack pointer | Dedicated register (x12) | Via function arguments |
| Element access | Direct offset from x12 | Pointer + offset |
| Push/Pop | ADDI x12, ±32 | N/A (function return) |
| Result storage | In-place on EVM stack | Return via pointer (a0) |

The dedicated stack pointer gives evm-asm advantages for stack-manipulation opcodes
(POP = 1 instruction, PUSH0 = 5, DUP1 = 9, SWAP1 = 16) and avoids `ret` overhead.

### Callee Overhead in Compiled Rust

Many Rust functions delegate to shared callees. The `partial_cmp` function (18 instrs,
4 branches) is called by 10 of our 21 functions. While code reuse is good for binary
size, it adds call overhead:

| Callee | Instructions | Branches | Called by |
|--------|:----------:|:--------:|-----------|
| partial_cmp | 18 | 4 | LT, GT, SLT, SGT, SHR, SHL, SAR, BYTE, SIGNEXTEND |
| div_mod | 724 | 74 | DIV, MOD |
| shl helper | 83 | 8 | SHL, SAR, SIGNEXTEND |
| memcmp | ~13 | ~3 | EQ |

Each call adds prologue/epilogue overhead (save/restore ra + s-registers), typically
4-10 instructions per call site.

### Recommendations

For a zkVM EVM implementation optimizing for prover cost on **riscv64**:

1. **Compiled Rust is competitive for simple operations** — ADD, SUB, MUL, AND, OR,
   XOR, NOT, ISZERO, LT, EQ are within 1-2 instructions of optimal.

2. **Avoid `core::mem::swap`** for U256 — this remains the #1 optimization target.
   Use explicit `ld`/`sd` word-level swap (9.3x improvement available).

3. **Hand-written assembly still wins for complex operations** — shifts (1.5-2.7x),
   SIGNEXTEND (4.7x), and division (2.5x) have significant callee overhead.

4. **Inline `partial_cmp`** — this single callee affects 10 opcodes. Inlining it
   would save 4-8 instructions per call site (call overhead + prologue/epilogue).

5. **Specialize division for U256** — the generic `div_mod` (724 instrs) is 2.3x
   larger than evm-asm's specialized version (316 instrs).

## Reproduction

### Building the Rust crate
```bash
cd rust-u256-asm
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm -C target-feature=-c" cargo build --release --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
# Assembly output: target/riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf/release/deps/u256_asm_compare-*.s
```

`-C target-feature=-c` disables compressed (2-byte) instructions so all instructions
are 4 bytes, matching evm-asm's RV64IM instruction set for fair comparison.

### Counting instructions
```bash
# Extract function bodies and count non-directive, non-label lines
python3 -c "
import re
with open('target/riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf/release/deps/u256_asm_compare-*.s') as f:
    # Count RISC-V instruction mnemonics per function label
    ...
"
```
